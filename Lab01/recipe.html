        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
                <li>2 cups Granny Smith apples (3 large or 4 small apples)</li>
                <li>1 whole lemon</li>
                <li>1/4 cup softened butter (4 tablespoons or half a stick)</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 cups flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Enough vegetable shortening to grease a 9by9-inch baking pan</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup apple cider</li>
                <li>1 cup confectioner sugar</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream or milk</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the first cup of apple cider on the stove and bring to a boil and boil until reduced to Â¼ cup. Set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Core and peel the apples and then cut each into 16 slices (fewer slices if using smaller apples). Have a bowl of water that has a whole lemon squeezed into it. Place apples into water and then onto a plate to dry and set aside. This will keep them from turning brown.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar until well mixed.</li>
                <li>With the mixer running, add one egg at a time beating until smooth. Scrap sides and beat until light and fluffy, about three minutes.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, sift flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.</li>
                <li>Measure out cream and add cooled reduced cider to cream.</li>
                <li>With the mixer on low, alternate adding the flour mixture and the cream/cider mixture until well combined. Scrape sides and mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Grease a 9X9 square pan liberally with vegetable shortening and pour in the batter.</li>
                <li>Arrange the apples, outer edges up into the top of the batter.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl or cup, mix the sugar with cinnamon and sprinkle over the top of the cake and place in the oven for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>While the cake is baking, make the glaze.</li>
                <li>Place the second cup of apple cider on the stove as before only reduce down to two tablespoons. Watch it that it does not evaporate too far.</li>
                <li>Place the confectioners sugar in a small bowl and add the reduced cider along with one tablespoon of milk or cream and stir. Add the last tablespoon of milk or cream a little at a time until desired consistency. It should be thick but runny enough to drizzle off the end of a spoon.</li>
                <li>When the cake comes out of the oven, cool to room temperature and cut into nine squares.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the glaze over each portion letting it run down the sides and serve.</li>
            </ol>

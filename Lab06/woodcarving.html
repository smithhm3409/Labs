        <h2>Wood Carving</h2>
        <p>I particularly like wood carving as well! It is such a fun activity and the end product is always good for gifts and keepsakes. Often times, there is wood that is better for carving than others, depending on what they will be used for. Some examples could be carving spoons, trinkets, or large outdoor carving. On this page, we will focus on smaller wood carving projects that would be effective for beginners as well.</p>

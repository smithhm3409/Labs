            <h3>Senior (technically 5th year but it's only a semester).</h3>
            <p>I am hoping to learn more about coding and web design in general as it is useful for my furture career. I think that this skill will help me greatly in my career but also it is super fun so far as well. Very excited to learn more!</p>
            <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
            <p>My favorite things are crocheting, painting, reading, and gardening! I also have just started making my own butter from scratch so that has been super fun to learn as well. I have also started working with clay recently and it has been interesting!</p>
